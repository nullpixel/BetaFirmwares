#BetaFirmwares

###### An open-source Swift project that pulls OTA updates from Apple, and checks the data type.

This is in complete beta, and things such as builds, duplicate removal, and pull to refresh are not in here.
If you want to add these things yourself, please make a pull request.

Thanks to [/u/AppleBetas](https://reddit.com/user/AppleBetas) for helping me loop through JSON; I personally have never worked with JSON in swift, only in Obj-C, so a lot of credit should go to him.
